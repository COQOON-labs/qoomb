This directory contains architecture decision records for the Qoomb project.
We use [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) format.

## Format

Each ADR follows the MADR template:

- **Status** — Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context** — What is the issue? What forces are at play?
- **Decision** — What is the change being proposed/made?
- **Consequences** — What becomes easier or harder?
